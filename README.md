# Product_Weight_Project
 LIDA Project 2. Standardised Products Database

Weight data is often missing from unpackaged products. We need to produce a generally accepted standard product weight data to use in the absense of retailer-specific data (Sold weights and Portion weights) 

# Aim
**Goal 1**: Produce a product list and meta-data documentation of info sources and decisions made.

The main principles were to keep the variants most likely on sale in stores.

**Goal 2**: Engage with the IGDâ€™s Industry Nutrition and Sustainability working Group to understand industry need for these data & generate buy-in for OB4</font>

**Goal 3**: Integrate a weight data checking and validation algorithm into current data pipelines.</font>

**Goal 4**: Produce an algorithm to match product list to commerical product list.</font>
