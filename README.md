# Product_Weight_Project
 LIDA Project 2. Standardised Products Database

Store product data is found in multiple location and/or often contains missing weight information for unpackaged and package products. We need to produce a generally accepted standard product weight data to use in the absense of retailer-specific data (Sold weights and Portion weights) in order to explore varying compontent of human interaction with retail purchases such as understanding the carbon footprint of a persons grocery shop or calculating the total number of calories from a persons basket shop. 



# Aim
**Goal 1**: Produce a product list and meta-data documentation of info sources and decisions made.
